# Glyphs

Many of the special typographic features within fonts — from bullets and em dashes to fractions — cannot be found on the keyboard. [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/glyphs/holbdohcbcodlejipgcmdleppjmfffhi) provides quick access to common special characters through the floating window displayed on the page.

The extension glyph set includes **605 characters**, mostly from AGLFN (Adobe Glyph List For New Fonts) a list of base glyphs that are recommended for new fonts, extended with all Unicode dashes and whitespace that are especially useful to editors.

Each character is assigned to one or more categories: Basic Latin and Latin 1, Extended Latin A and B, Punctuation, Dashes & Quotes, Whitespace, Currency, Numbers, Math Symbols, Symbols, Greek and Coptic

## Limitations:
- adding glyph to the empty editable content in React environment causes an error (mainly Facebook)
- iframe cross-domain policy

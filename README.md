# Glyphs

Many of the special typographic features within fonts — from bullets and em dashes to fractions and ligatures — cannot be found on the keyboard. [Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/glyphs/holbdohcbcodlejipgcmdleppjmfffhi) provides quick access to common special characters through the dynamic window displayed on the page.

This set includes: **586** glyphs from **AGLFN** (Adobe Glyph List For New Fonts) a list of base characters that are recommended for new fonts, extended with **19** that cover all punctuation and whitespace glyphs.

Each character is assigned to one or more categories: Basic Latin and Latin 1, Extended Latin A and B, Punctuation, Dashes & Quotes, Whitespace, Currency, Numbers, Math Symbols, Symbols, Greek and Coptic

## Limitations:
- adding glyph to the empty editable content in React environment causes an error (mainly Facebook)
- iframe cross-domain policy
